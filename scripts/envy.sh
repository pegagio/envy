# envy - A Bash proxy for the envy Go layer
#
# This script acts as a transparent proxy to the Go-based `envy` CLI.
# It:
# - Passes the current shell environment state to the Go layer.
# - Updates the shell environment based on the output of `bin/envy`.
# - Tracks loaded environments dynamically using the ENVYLOADED variable.
#
# Usage:
#   envy load <profile>    # Load an environment
#   envy unload <profile>  # Unload an environment
#   envy list              # List all environments
#
# The `envy` function automatically modifies the environment by:
# - Setting variables, modifying PATH, and adding aliases when loading.
# - Unsetting variables, restoring PATH, and removing aliases when unloading.
#
# ENVYLOADED tracks active environments as a comma-separated list.
#
# This script should be sourced in your shell configuration file:
#   source /path/to/envy.sh
#
# Dependencies:
# - Requires `bin/envy` (Go CLI) in the PATH or specified manually.
